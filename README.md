# MedNCA
PyTorch implementation of a Neural Cellular Automaton as proposed by the Paper ["Growing Neural Cellular Automata"](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/), trained on medical images from [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) and visualized using Pygame.

This project was done as part of the lecture Deep Generative Models at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp).

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Run `main.py` to start the interactive demonstration.

Edit and run `start_training.py` to train a new model.
